So my personal opinion is that the real value is in how we are able to help in the decision making process - both the buyer and the seller (and not focus so much in how we enable communication or the sale itself or the fulfillment like amazon)

Buyer needs
 - product discovery, product comparison, 
 - price history and as KBB.com shows for a car - the best market price and the price that you should ask the dealer to begin the negotiation (and the final price which most of the other people are settling for)

Seller needs
 - buyer profile - spending pattern, shopping pattern, appetite for negotiation (aggressive v\s soft)
 - a predefined analytical model using which he can determine what is the right price point for a type of buyer profile; so that he can predict (or atleast speculate) his right price and understand how his investments can panout. If the buyer asks for a price below the reasonable price point then the seller can right away reject; if it is near the price point then the seller has incentive to negotiate and protect his customer and the price. So the key in developing this model - as Rohit was mentioning in our discussion last time - the lowest attractive price for the seller.
 - once we build a history of negotiated price for a particular product I think that can help us determine the moving weighted average price and determine the price range where there is the best possibility of the deal happening - for both the seller and the buyer - and the system should drive both the seller and buyer to this price point.

I think we should model a real negotiating exercise and see how many of the data points can be predicted or calculated and then facilitate this in the solution.
